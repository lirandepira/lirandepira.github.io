# Research Profile

I thrive at intersections of ideas. If you look at my CV (will linkedin do?), there is one pattern you will observe: I move a lot. And not only geographically, but also across different fields and patterns of thinking.

More formally, I introduce myself as a computer scientist, and to my advantage, computer science is a massive crossroad. It has enabled me to build software, build software that builds software through AI, and then take it up a notch with quantum physics and make quantum algorithms and software.

I research how quantum machines will learn. This has demanded a strong interdisciplinary approach, fostering collaboration between computer science, physics, and mathematics â€” essential skills for engaging in the dynamic landscape of quantum AI research. And it will continue to do so.
