## Research Profile

I thrive at intersections of ideas. If you look at my [profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lirandepira/), there is one pattern you will observe: I move a lot. And not only geographically, but also across different fields and patterns of thinking.

More formally, I introduce myself as a computer scientist, and computer science is a massive crossroad of ideas. It has enabled me to build software, build software that builds software through AI, and then take it up a notch with quantum physics and make quantum software and algorithms.

Now I research how quantum machines will learn. More broadly, I am interested in deep learning, theoretical machine learning, quantum machine learning, quantum algorithms, and their subsequent disruptive applications.

Within the paradigm of quantum machine learning, I argue that quantum machine learning is a branch of machine learning, and not quantum physics. This shift in perspective regarding our approach to quantum machine learning will expand our understanding of how much further AI can go, as well as what we can do with quantum computers.
